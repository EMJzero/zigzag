##### ZigZag Conv -> FF MatMul #####
# K -> D
# C -> E
# OY -> L

##### Translatio ZigZag mapping -> FF:
# 1) Go top-down over the loops of ZZ
# 2) Place a loop on the inner-most indicated memory level whose operand is affected by
#    the dimension currently being iterated (e.g. ignore Out if the loops is on E).
# 3) Verify dataflows.
